The best way to describe my style as a therapist is that I can hold the space for your vulnerability yet also not afraid to speak about the areas for improvement. I hold my clients accountable but in an empathetic and caring manner. As a modern therapist, I laugh with you while you chuckle to some fire memes, and I can also cuss with you while you complain about that frustrating situation at work last week. My clients are the captain of the ship, and I am the first mate to support them to get to where they want to be.

I prioritize the mind and body connection to promote emotional wellbeing. Weightlifting, yoga, walking my senior Pembroke Welsh Corgi (Teemo!) are some of my favorite ways to move my body!
